Thanks for downloading this program!
This is my first application I have made and am publicly releasing.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
1. Download the zip file (which you've already done)
2. Extract the files (do this if you're reading this through 7-Zip, WinRAR, etc.)
3. Run encoderdecoder.exe through the command line or through File Explorer

FAQ
Q: I can't run this application. Why is this?
A: You may not have the right version of Pytho installed. The version I used to write and build this is Python 3.7.2 64-bit, but any version of Python 3 should work.

Q: Why can't I run this on Windows 95/98/NT4/2000/Me/XP?
A: All operating systems prior to Windows XP are 32-bit only. Only some Windows XP systems are 64-bit. I'm currently working on a way to build them on older Python versions such as 2.7.16, but this might take a while.

Q: What is VCRUNTIME140.dll?
A: VCRUNTIME140.dll is a file used in cx_Freeze, the application building program I use to make applications from Python files. Don't worry about it!

Q: How do I know this isn't a virus?
A: I wouldn't ever think of releasing a virus into anyone's systems! It's unethical and for starters, I don't even know how to make one. You can always check the files in VirusTotal (https://www.virustotal.com) or by verifying the SHA1 checksum at onlinemd5.com. Simply enter the SHA1 checksum listed below into the "Compare With" field (make sure to click the SHA1 radio button!) then drag and drop the encoderdecoder.exe file onto the browser.

Again, thanks for downloading! I really appreciate it!
